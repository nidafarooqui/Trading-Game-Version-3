# Trading-Game-Version-3

This is a simple two player trading cards game developed for android 
in which one mobile acts as the server and the other as the client.

It is a simplified version of Settlers of Catan and was developed for a research project I was doing.

I went through the UX design process and did A/B testing in the end to test my app.
